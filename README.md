A Streamlit web app for spam email classification using machine learning. The app allows users to input an email and classify it as either 'Spam' or 'Ham' based on a pre-trained model and TfidfVectorizer. It uses scikit-learn for model training and Streamlit for the user interface.

Below are some important points about the project:
* A logistic regression model is used for predictions.
* TfidfVectorizer is used for feature extraction process.
* .pkl file contains the trained models
